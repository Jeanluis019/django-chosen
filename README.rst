django-chosen
=============

*django-chosen* is a project that makes available django FormFields that
uses the `Chosen javascript plugin`_. It was created by developers at
`The Atlantic`_.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install from source is with pip::

    $ pip install -e git+git://github.com/theatlantic/django-chosen.git

If the source is already checked out, use setuptools::

    $ python setup.py install

Configuration
-------------

By default *django-chosen* serves up the javascript and css through django.
For this to work, include chosen.urls in your urls.py::

    url_patterns = (
        # ...
        (r'^desired-path-to-chosen/', include('chosen.urls')),
    )

If you would like to serve the contents of ``chosen/media`` directly from
your webserver, set ``CHOSEN_MEDIA_URL`` in your settings.py to point to
the url you have aliased to the chosen media directory (or where you have
copied them).

Usage
-----

*django-chosen* makes available the following fields and widget:

- ``ChosenChoiceField``
- ``ChosenModelChoiceField``
- ``ChosenMultipleChoiceField``
- ``ChosenModelMultipleChoiceField``
- ``ChosenSelect``
- ``ChosenSelectMultiple``

All of these fields have the same import path as their django counterparts,
save the fact that the root module is ``chosen`` instead of ``django``.

The *django-chosen* fields can be passed an optional kwarg ``overlay`` that
overrides the text which appears when no option is selected in the dropdown.

Example
-------

::

    from django import forms
    from chosen import forms as chosenforms
    
    class BookForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
        quality = chosenforms.ChosenChoiceField(overlay="Select book quality...",
            choices=(('New', 'new'), ('Used', 'used')))
        authors = chosenforms.ChosenModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Author.objects.all())
